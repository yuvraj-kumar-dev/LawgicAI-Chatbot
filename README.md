- 🧠 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** backed memory
- 🗃️ Custom **vectorstore using FAISS** for fast retrieval
- 🛡️ Avoids hallucinations — answers are based on your uploaded documents
- 🧩 Modular code (`create_memory.py`, `connect_memory.py`, `chatbot.py`)
- ⚡ Instant and interactive UI with **Streamlit**
- 📁 Clean folder structure with `data/` and `vectorstore/` separation

---

## 🧠 Architecture

```plaintext
📁 data/
   └── your uploaded PDFs
📁 vectorstore/db_faiss/
   └── vector index stored here
📄 create_memory.py
   └── Converts PDFs to chunks → embeds with LLM → stores vectors
📄 connect_memory.py
   └── Loads vectorstore and connects it to LLM
📄 chatbot.py
   └── Streamlit UI to chat with your knowledge base
```
